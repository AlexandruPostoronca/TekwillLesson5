<div class="alert alert-primary">Wow! This problem is kind of tricky. If you're ready to put your thinking cap on, brace
    yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later
</div>
<p>Imagine a chocolate bar. Remember how it is usually split into smaller bits by a special grid?</p>
<p>Now think of chocolate as an N x M rectangle divided into little segments: N segments in length and M in width. Each
    segment is 1x1 and <em>unbreakable</em>. Find out whether it is possible to break off exactly K segments from the
    chocolate with a single straight line: vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p><strong>Input data format</strong></p>
<p>The program gets an input of three integers: N, M, K.</p>
<p><strong>Output data format</strong></p>
<p>The program must output one of the two words: <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble understanding the task, try drawing it on a piece of paper.</p>
