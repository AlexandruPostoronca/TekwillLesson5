<h2>Conditional statement</h2>
<p>The <strong>conditional statement</strong> is a construction that allows a program to perform different computations
    depending on the value of a Boolean expression. If it is <code>true</code>, the program
    performs one computation; otherwise, if it is <code>false</code>, the program performs another
    computation. Here are some examples of Boolean expressions: <code>a &gt; b</code>, <code
    >i - j == 1</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The conditional statement has different forms. We will use all of them.</p>

<h4>The single if-case</h4>
<p>The simplest form of the conditional statement consists of the keyword <code>if</code>, a Boolean expression enclosed
    in parentheses, and a body enclosed in curly braces.</p>

<pre><code>if (expression) {
    // body: do something
}</code></pre>

<p>If the expression is <code>true</code>, the statements inside the code block are executed; otherwise, the program
    skips them.</p>
<p>See the following example.</p>

<pre><code>int age = ...; // it has a value
if (age > 100) {
    System.out.println("Very experienced person");
}</code></pre>

<p>In this example, if the <code>age</code> is greater than 100 the code prints <strong>"Very experienced person"
</strong>, otherwise, it does nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will see a situation where the expression in a condition is a single <code>boolean</code> type
    variable. Instead of writing <code>b == true</code> or <code>b == false</code>, use this variable (or its negation
    with <code>!</code>) as the Boolean expression:</p>

<pre><code>boolean b = ...; // it is true or false
if (b) { // or !b
    // do something
}</code></pre>

<p>A conditional statement can be used in any place in a program where the statement is expected. It can even be nested
    inside another conditional statement to perform multistage checks.</p>

<h4>The if-else-cases</h4>
<p>The if-case above can be extended with the keyword <code>else</code> and another body to do alternative actions when
    the expression is <code>false</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if (expression) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
} </code></pre>

<p>In this case, if the expression is <code>true</code>, then the first code block is executed; otherwise, the second
    code block is executed, but not both together.</p>

<p>In the example below, the program outputs different text depending on the value of <code>num</code> (even or odd).
</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">
    Note: a number is even if it can be divided exactly by 2; otherwise it's odd.
</div>

<pre><code>int num = ...; // the num is initialized by some value

if (num % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("It's an even number");
} else {
    System.out.println("It's an odd number");
}</code></pre>

<p>Since a number can only be even or odd, only one message will be displayed. If <code>num</code> is 10, the program
    outputs <code>"It's an even number"</code>. If the value is 11, it outputs <code>"It's an odd number"</code>.</p>

<h4>The if-else-if-cases</h4>
<p>The most general form of the conditional statement consists of several conditions and <code>else-if</code>-branches.
</p>
<pre><code>if (expression0) {
    // do something
} else if (expression1) {
    // do something else 1
// ...
} else if (expressionN) {
    // do something else N
}</code></pre>
<p>The following code outputs recommendations about what computer you need to buy depending on your budget.</p>
<pre><code>long dollars = ...; // your budget

if (dollars < 1000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a laptop");
} else if (dollars < 2000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a personal computer");
} else if (dollars < 100_000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a server");
} else {
    System.out.println("Buy a data center or a quantum computer");
}</code></pre>

<p>This conditional statement has four branches: <code>dollars &lt; 1000</code>, <code>dollars &lt; 2000</code>, <code>dollars
    &lt; 100_000</code> and <code>dollars &gt;= 100_000</code>. For example, if the value of <code>dollars</code> is
    <code>10_000</code>, it prints <code>"Buy a server"</code> because <code>10_000</code> is more than
    <code>2000</code> , which means that the first and the second conditions are false, and less than
    <code>100_000</code> , which means that the third condition is true.</p>

<p>A conditional statement with multiple branches creates a <strong>decision tree</strong>, whose nodes consist of
    boolean expressions, and each branch is marked with <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. The <em>true</em>-branch leads
    to a block of statements to be executed and a <code>false</code>-branch leads to the next condition to be checked.
    The last false-branch means <strong>"</strong><em>in all other cases</em><strong>"</strong>.</p>

    When talking about conditions, programmers often use the term "control flow statements".
    <strong>Control flow</strong> is the order in which various parts of a program are executed. You will probably meet
    this term in our topics and on other external resources.

<p>The picture below demonstrates such a tree for the example with computers.</p>
