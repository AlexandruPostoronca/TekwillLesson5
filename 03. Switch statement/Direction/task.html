<h2>Direction</h2>
<p>Write a program, which reads the number of direction (1 – up, 2 – down, 3 – left, 4 – right, 0 – do
    not move) and outputs the text "<strong>move up</strong>" (or "move down", or "move left", or "move right", or
    "do not move" depending on the entered number). If it is a number that does not belong to any of the listed
    directions, the program should output "<strong>error!</strong>"</p>

<p>Note: the output text should exactly match the sample, including the letters' case and location of spaces.</p>
