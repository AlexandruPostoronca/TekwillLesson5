<h2>Shape</h2>
<p>Write a program, which reads the number of the shape (1 – square, 2 – circle, 3 – triangle, 4 –
    rhombus) and prints the text "<strong>You have chosen a square</strong>" (or
    circle, or triangle, or rhombus, depending on the number). If it is a number that doesn't correspond to any of the
    listed shapes, the program should output: "<strong>There is no such shape!</strong>".</p>

<p>Note: the output text should <strong>exactly</strong> match the sample, including letters' case and location of
    spaces.</p>
