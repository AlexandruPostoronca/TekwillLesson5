<h2>Test learners</h2><p>We need your help to improve an adaptive system. There's a program that asks learners what programming language they are learning. There are four options, one of them is correct:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Java</strong></li>
	<li>Kotlin</li>
	<li>Scala</li>
	<li>Python</li>
</ol>

<p>Your task: read the answer's number from the standard input and output the result of the test: "<strong>Yes!</strong>", "<strong>No!</strong>" or "<strong>Unknown number</strong>". We hope you know which answer is correct. You don't need to print the question itself.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>1</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>Yes!</pre></div><div><p><strong> Sample Input 2: </strong></p><pre>6</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 2: </strong></p><pre>Unknown number</pre></div>
