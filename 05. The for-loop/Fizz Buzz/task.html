<h2>Fizz Buzz</h2><p>Fizz Buzz is a classic programming problem. Here is its slightly modified version.</p>

<p>Write a program that takes two integers as the input: the beginning and the end of the interval (both numbers belong to the interval).</p>

<p>The program should output the numbers from this interval, but if the number is divisible by 3, you should output Fizz instead of it; if the number is divisible by 5, output Buzz; and if it is divisible both by 3 and by 5, output FizzBuzz.</p>

<p>Output each number or the word on a separate line.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>8 16</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>8
