<h2>Grades</h2><p>Find the number of D, C, B and A grades for the last test on informatics, where <em><strong>n</strong></em>
    students from a class have successfully passed the test. </p>

<p>The program gets number <em><strong>n</strong></em> as the first line of input and then gets the grades themselves,
    each on a new line.</p>

<p>The program must output four numbers in a single line: the number of D, C, B, and A grades (in that order), separated
    by blank space characters.</p>
