<h2>Maximum element divisible by four</h2>
<p>Given a sequence of natural numbers, not exceeding 30000. Find the maximum element divisible by 4. There is always an
    element divisible by 4 in the sequence and the number of elements does not exceed 1000.</p>

<p>As input, the program receives the number of elements in the sequence <strong>n</strong> (first line) and then the
    elements themselves (next n lines). The program should print a single number: the maximum element of the sequence
    divisible by 4.</p>

<p>Try to solve this problem by using a for-loop.</p>
