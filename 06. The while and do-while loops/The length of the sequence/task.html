<h2>The length of the sequence</h2>
<p>For its input, the program gets a sequence of non-negative integers; each integer is written on a separate line. The sequence ends with an integer 0; when the program reads 0, it should end its work and output the length of the sequence (not counting the final 0).</p>
<p>Don't read numbers following the number 0.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>1
