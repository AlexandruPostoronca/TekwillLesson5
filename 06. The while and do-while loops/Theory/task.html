<h2>The while and do-while loops</h2><p>There are a number of approaches to repeating a fragment of the code while a
    certain condition is <code>true</code>. In this lesson, we will learn how to do it by using two kinds of loops. They
    differ in the order of the repeated fragment execution and condition evaluation.</p>

<h4>The while loop</h4><p>The <strong>while</strong> loop consists of a block of code and a condition (a Boolean
    expression). If the condition is <code>true</code>, the code within the block is executed. This code repeats until
    the condition becomes <code>false</code>. Since this loop checks the condition before the block is executed, the
    control structure is also known as a <strong>pre-test loop</strong>. You can think of the <strong>while</strong>
    loop as a repetitive conditional statement.</p><p>The basic syntax of the <strong>while</strong> loop is the
    following:</p>
<pre><code>while (condition) {
    // body: do something repetitive
}</code>
</pre><p>A loop's body can contain any correct Java statements, including
    conditional statements and even other loops, the latter being called nested loops.</p><p>It is also possible to
    write an <strong>infinite loop</strong> if the condition is invariably <code>true</code>:</p>
<pre><code>while (true) {
    // body: do something indefinitely
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The application of infinite loops will be considered in the following topics.</p><p><strong>Example 1.</strong>
    The following loop prints integer numbers while a variable is less than 5.
</p>
<pre><code>int i = 0;
while(i &lt; 5) {
    System.out.println(i); i++;
}
// next statement</code>
</pre>
<p>Let's explain how this loop
    works. First, the value 0 is assigned to the variable <code>i</code>. Before the first execution of the loop's body,
    the program checks if the condition <code>i &lt; 5</code> is true. In our case, <code>i</code> is 0, so the
    condition is true and the body of the loop starts executing. The body has two statements: displaying the current
    value of <code>i</code> and incrementing it by 1. After this is done, the expression <code>i &lt; 5</code> is
    evaluated again. Now <code>i</code> equals 1, so the condition is still <code>true</code>, and the loop's body is
    repeated. This is repeated until <code>i</code> has taken the value 5, after which the expression <code>i &lt;
        5</code> ceases to be <code>true</code>, and the execution of this loop terminates. The program proceeds to the
    next statement after the loop.</p><p><strong>The output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>0
1
2
3
4</code>
</pre>
<p>Note that the last value of <code>i</code>, that is 5, is not printed.</p><p><strong>Example 2. </strong>
    The following program displays English letters in a single line.</p>
<pre><code>public class WhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char letter = 'A';
        while (letter &lt;= 'Z') {
            System.out.print(letter);
            letter++;
        }
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The program takes the first letter <code>'A'</code> and then goes on like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>if the <code>letter</code> is less than or equal to <code>'Z'</code> the program goes to the loop's body;</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>inside the body, it prints the current character and <code>letter</code> takes the next alphabet letter.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The program prints:</p>
<pre><code>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Remember that it is possible to get the next character according to the Unicode
    table by using the increment operator. After the code execution, the <code>letter</code> will equal <code>[</code>.
</p></div>

<h4>The do-while loop</h4><p>In the <strong>do-while</strong> loop, the body is executed first, while the condition is
    tested afterwards. If the condition is <code>true</code>, statements within the block are executed again. This
    repeats until the condition becomes <code>false</code>. Because <strong>do-while</strong> loops check the condition
    after the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a <strong>post-test loop</strong>. In
    contrast to the <strong>while </strong>loop, which tests the condition before the code within the block is executed,
    the <strong>do-while</strong> loop is an exit-condition loop. So, the code within the block is always executed at
    least once.</p><p>This loop contains three parts: the <code>do</code> keyword, a body, and
    <code>while(condition)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>do {
    // body: do something
} while (condition);</code>
</pre>
<p>A good example of using it is a program that reads data from the standard input until a user enters a certain number
    or string. The following program reads integer numbers from the standard input and displays them. If the number
    0 is entered, the program prints it and then stops. The following example demonstrates the <strong>do-while</strong>
    loop:</p>
<pre><code>class DoWhileDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int value;
        do {
            value = scanner.nextInt();
            System.out.println(value);
        } while (value != 0);
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Input numbers:</p>
<pre><code>1 2 4 0 3</code></pre>
<p>The program prints:</p>
<pre><code>1
2
4
0</code>
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that like the <strong>while </strong>loop, the <strong>do-while</strong> loop
    can be infinite.</p></div><p>In practice, the <strong>do-while</strong> loop is used less than the
    <strong>while </strong>loop. It is used when code inside the loop must be executed at least once.</p>

<h4>Reading a sequence with an unknown length</h4>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop can also be used to read a sequence of characters of an arbitrary length. For that, we
    can invoke the <code>hasNextInt()</code> method of<code>Scanner</code> inside the condition. The method returns
    <code>true</code> if the next element is an integer number and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>Here is a code that calculates the sum of all elements from the provided sequence:</p>
<pre><code>Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int sum = 0;
while (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
    int elem = scanner.nextInt();
    sum += elem;
}
System.out.println(sum);</code>
</pre>
<p>If the input sequence is <code>1 2 3</code>, the code prints <code>6</code>, if it is <code>5 18 9 23 4</code>, the
    code prints <code>59</code>.</p>
<p>As you see, the <strong>while</strong> loop can be used to solve different interesting tasks in your programs.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>There are different ways to perform some fragments of your code several times. In this topic,
    we've discussed two alternative ways to use loops that are based on conditional statement evaluation. If you want to
    check the condition first and, based on the result, perform the operations or ignore them at all, the
    <strong>while </strong>loop is your choice. If you want to do one iteration of the loop in any case and then
    evaluate the condition for repetition, then choose <strong>do-while</strong>. Both types of loops can be used to
    read a sequence from the standard input: for <strong>do-while</strong>, you may use some stop value to terminate the
    loop, for <strong>while</strong>, use the <code>hasNext()</code> method to check that the input is over.</p>
