<h2>The sequence</h2>
<p>Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (the number is repeated as many times, to what it equals to). The input to the program is a positive integer n: the number of the elements of the sequence the program should print. Output the sequence of numbers, written in a single line, space-separated.</p>

<p>For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>7</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>1 2 2 3 3 3 4</pre></div>
