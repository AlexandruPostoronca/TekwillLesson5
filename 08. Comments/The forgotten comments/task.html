<h2>The forgotten comments</h2>
<p>Programmers wrote a code with a lot of comments, but they forgot to add the required symbol for comments. As a result, the code does not compile. You need to comment some lines in this code to make it compile.</p>

<p>Please, do not remove already written comments!</p>
