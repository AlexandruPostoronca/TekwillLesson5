<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Inside a Java program, you can write a special text that will be ignored by the Java compiler â€”
    known as the <strong>comment</strong>. Comments allow you to exclude code from the compilation process (disable it)
    or clarify a piece of code to yourself or other developers. In our materials, we use comments in the theory and
    practice lessons to explain how and why our code works.</p>
<p>The Java programming language supports three kinds of comments.</p>

<h4>End-of-line comments</h4>
<p>The Java compiler ignores any text from <code>//</code> to the end of the line.</p>
<pre><code>class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // The line below will be ignored
        // System.out.println("Hello, World");
        // It prints the string "Hello, Java"
        System.out.println("Hello, Java"); // Here can be any comment
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In the example above the text after <code>//</code> is ignored by the compiler.</p>

<h4>Multi-line comments</h4>
<p>The compiler ignores any text from <code>/*</code> and the nearest <code>*/</code>. It can be used as multiple and
    single-line comments.</p>
<pre><code>class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* This is a single-line comment */
        /*  This is an example of
            a multi-line comment */
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>You can use comments inside other comments:</p>
<pre><code>class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*
        System.out.println("Hello"); // print "Hello"
        System.out.println("Java");  // print "Java"
        */
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The part of the code above is ignored by the compiler because of <code>/* ... */</code> comments.</p>

<h4>Java documentation comments</h4>
<p>The compiler ignores any text from <code>/**</code> to <code>*/</code> just like it ignores multi-line comments.</p>
<p>These kinds of comments can be used to automatically generate documentation about your source code by using
    the<strong> javadoc </strong>tool. Usually, these comments are placed above declarations of classes, interfaces,
    methods and so on. Some special labels such as <code>@param</code> or <code>@return</code> are often used for
    controlling the tool. However, they are optional and we will not deal with them for now. Just don't be surprised in
    case you see them.</p>
<p>See the example below.</p>
<pre><code>class Program {
    /**
     * The main method accepts an array of string arguments
     *
     * @param args from the command line
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // do nothing
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Do not be afraid if you have not understood <strong>the documentation comments</strong> completely. This will be
    considered in other topics.</p>
